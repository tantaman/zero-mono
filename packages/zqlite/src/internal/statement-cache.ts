 * needs enough headroom for callers with a large working set of distinct
 * SQL — e.g. the replication change-processor prepares several statements
 * per table (with additional variants for partial-column updates) through
 * a single cache — while still capping growth from unbounded key spaces

/**
 * SQLite statement preparation isn't cheap as it involves evaluating possible
 * query plans and picking the best one (in addition to parsing the SQL).
 *
 * This statement cache prevents the need to re-prepare the same statement
 * multiple times.
 *
 * One extra wrinkle is that a single statement cannot be used by multiple
 * callers at the same time. As in, we can't `iterate` the same statement
 * many times concurrently.
 *
 * Given that, statements are removed from the cache while in use.
 * - `get` removes the statement from the cache
 * - `return` adds it back.
 *
 * If a request for the same sql is made while a
 * statement is gotten, a new statement will be prepared.
 * Both statements can be returned to the cache even though they both
 * serve the same SQL. Having both copies returned to the cache allows
 * the cache to serve multiple callers concurrently in the future.
 *
 * It is not an error to fail to call `return` on a statement.
 * Failing to call return will only prevent the statement from being reused
 * by other callers. It will not cause a resource leak.
 *
 * The cache is bounded: it retains at most `maxSize` statements, evicting
 * the least recently used statements when the bound is exceeded. Only idle
 * (returned) statements are ever evicted — statements checked out via `get`
 * are not in the cache and thus never touched by eviction. Evicting a
 * statement drops the cache's reference to it; the native `sqlite3_stmt`
 * handle is finalized when the Statement object is garbage collected.
