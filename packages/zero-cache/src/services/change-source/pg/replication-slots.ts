/**
 * Replica and slot creation involves two sessions for proper coordination
 * with other replica management logic:
 *
 * * A normal transaction is started and acquires an advisory lock for
 *   replica slot management. This is the same lock that cleanup logic
 *   acquires before cleaning up replication slots.
 * * With the lock held, a new replication slot is created in a
 *   replication session. The API of CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT is such
 *   that it cannot be done in a transaction, and cannot be followed by
 *   any writes, or else its snapshot (which is needed for initial sync)
 *   would be invalidated.
 * * Once the slot is created, the slot and replica information are recorded
 *   in the `replicas` table before releasing the lock.
 *
 * This locking ensures that:
 * 1. multiple replication managers attempting to create a replication slot
 *    will not use the same name for the replication slot (which is selected
 *    from a pool of reused names).
 * 2. Running replication managers (which use an earlier replica of a lower
 *    rank) will not delete the new slot during their cleanup logic, since
 *    the slot will belong to a replica of a higher rank.
 *
 * When the replication slot is created, `captureSnapshot` callback is first
 * run while the snapshot at the consistent point is available. The callback
 * must capture the snapshot in postgres (e.g. `SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT`)
 * in order to use it. Once the callback completes, a placeholder replication
 * session (i.e. that does not consume any messages) is started, in order to
 * reserve the slot by mark it "active", effectively distinguishing the
 * initializing session from a failed or abandoned session.
 *
 * Note that starting the replication session releases the initial snapshot,
 * which is why the callback must capture it synchronously, before the
 * replication session is started.
 *
 * The placeholder replication session is closed when the
 * PostgresChangeSource takes over the slot to process the stream in earnest.
 * It is also returned for cleanup in the case of failures (and for control
 * in unit tests).
