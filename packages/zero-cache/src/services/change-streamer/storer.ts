 * changes needed to catch a client up have been purged.
 *
 * **Maintained invariant**: The Change DB is only empty for a
 * completely new replica (i.e. initial-sync with no changes from the
 * replication stream).
 * * In this case, all new subscribers are expected start from the
 *   `replicaVersion`, which is the version at which initial sync
 *   was performed, and any attempts to catchup from a different
 *   point fail.
 *
 * Conversely, if non-initial changes have flowed through the system
 * (i.e. via the replication stream), the ChangeDB must *not* be empty,
 * and the earliest change in the `changeLog` represents the earliest
 * "commit" from (after) which a subscriber can be caught up.
 * * Any attempts to catchup from an earlier point must fail with
 *   a `WatermarkTooOld` error.
 * * Failure to do so could result in streaming changes to the
 *   subscriber such that there is a gap in its replication history.
 *
 * Note: Subscribers (i.e. `incremental-syncer`) consider an "error" signal
 * an unrecoverable error and shut down in response. This allows the
 * production system to replace it with a new task and fresh copy of the
 * replica backup.
