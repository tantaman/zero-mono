/**
 * The `snapshot` API serves the purpose of:
 * - informing subscribers (i.e. view-syncers) of the (litestream)
 *   backup location from which to restore a replica snapshot
 * - checking whether a restored backup or existing replica is
 *   compatible with the change-streamer
 * - preventing change-log cleanup while a snapshot restore is in
 *   progress
 * - tracking the approximate time it takes from the beginning of
 *   snapshot "reservation" to the subsequent subscription, which
 *   serves as the minimum interval to wait before cleaning up
 *   backed up changes.
