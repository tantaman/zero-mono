/**
 * Where a stream connection's initialization parameters come from.
 *
 * A change-streamer starts a stream from three things read at one position: the
 * watermark to resume at, the {@link BackfillRequest}s to hand the change
 * source, and the cookie set those requests were derived from. Postgres has
 * always supplied all three (`Storer.getStartStreamInitializationParameters()`).
 * The point of this workstream is that a restored replica can supply them
 * instead, which is what lets the `cdc` schema be decommissioned.
 *
 * This is the two-source stage. Both are computed on every stream connection,
 * compared, and Postgres's is used — so the replica-derived path runs in
 * production, at full rate, before anything depends on it. The flip is
 * `initFromPgChangeLog: false`, not a rewrite.
 *
 * The shape is {@link UpstreamAcker}'s, deliberately: two stores, one output, a
 * flag per store, and the Postgres flag carrying the marker that retires it.
 * That class solved the identical problem for upstream ACKs earlier in this
 * workstream.
 *
 * ### Why the comparison is a fold and not an equality
 *
 * The replica is a subscriber downstream of the change-streamer's write loop,
 * so its state version trails the log's head by however long the replicator is
 * behind. A raw difference between the two cookie sets is therefore the normal
 * case and says nothing. What is checked instead is that the replica's set,
 * carried forward over exactly the schema changes the log holds in the interval,
 * equals Postgres's set at Postgres's watermark. The log holds precisely those
 * transactions, schema changes are rare, and the check is exact rather than
 * approximate — so it also happens to be the strongest available test of the
 * premise that three interpreters of one fold agree.
