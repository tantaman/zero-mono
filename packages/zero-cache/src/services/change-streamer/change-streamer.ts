 * the associated upstream expense (e.g. PG replication slots are resource
 * intensive) with a "forward-store-ack" procedure.
 *
 * * Changes from the upstream source are immediately **forwarded** to
 *   connected subscribers to minimize latency.
 *
 * * They are then **stored** in a separate DB to facilitate catchup
 *   of connecting subscribers that are behind.
 *
 * * **Acknowledgements** are sent upstream after they are successfully
 *   stored.
 *
 * Unlike Postgres replication slots, in which the progress of a static
 * subscriber is tracked in the replication slot, the ChangeStreamer
 * supports a dynamic set of subscribers (i.e.. zero-caches) that can
 * can continually change.
 *
 * However, it is not the case that the ChangeStreamer needs to support
 * arbitrarily old subscribers. Because the replica is continually
 * backed up to a global location and used to initialize new subscriber
 * tasks, an initial subscription request from a subscriber constitutes
 * a signal for how "behind" a new subscriber task can be. This is
 * reflected in the {@link SubscriberContext}, which indicates whether
 * the watermark corresponds to an "initial" watermark derived from the
 * replica at task startup.
 *
 * The ChangeStreamer uses a combination of this signal with ACK
 * responses from connected subscribers to determine the watermark up
 * to which it is safe to purge old change log entries.

// v3: v0.20

// v4: v0.25
//   - Adds the "replicaVersion" and "minWatermark" fields to the "/snapshot"
