/**
 * The change log lives in its own SQLite database, `${replicaFile}-change-log`,
 * rather than in the replica file. It is a catchup cache: everything it holds is
 * either already durable in the replica's litestream backup or re-derivable from
 * the upstream replication slot, so it is deliberately excluded from the backup
 * and is never a source of truth.
 *
 * The change-streamer writes it, from the stream loop that fans changes out to
 * subscribers, and commits it before forwarding each transaction's `commit`
 * message. Its head is therefore always at or above the watermark the stream
 * would resume from, which is what {@link reconcileChangeLog} anchors on.
 *
 * Beside the buffer it holds the log's *cookie jar* — the backfill progress
 * state folded up to the same head. That is `change-log-cookies.ts`; this file
 * owns its tables' lifecycle, because a cookie set is only meaningful paired
 * with the watermark it was folded to, and so must be created, dropped, and —
 * whenever reconciliation moves the head — replaced with the anchor's, all with
 * the buffer rather than beside it.
 *
 * Because it is disposable, it has no migration framework. Any inconsistency —
 * a schema change, a leftover file from a different replica, a gap left by a
 * crash or by running with the writer disabled, a corrupt file — is resolved by
 * {@link reconcileChangeLog} and {@link openChangeLogDBForWriting}, which
 * truncate a bounded suffix or replace and reseed the log at the resume
 * watermark. The worst outcome is a `too-old` for a lagging subscriber; a
 * silently delivered gap is not reachable.
 *
 * Disk sizing: a task that writes the log needs room for the replica *plus* the
 * retained change stream — the log's main file, its wal2 sidecars, and pages a
 * purge has freed but not yet returned to the OS. The change-streamer schedules
 * purges against the same floor as the PG change log, so retention is bounded
 * by the confirmed backup watermark ANDed with the minimum retention window —
 * a function of the backup interval, not a constant: 15–30+ minutes behind an
 * RMv1 sync interval, ~60 seconds once litestream v5 backs up every 15–30 s.
 * A held snapshot reservation pins retention unboundedly for its duration, so
 * peak retained bytes is set by the slowest concurrent restore rather than by
 * the retention setting — size disk and alerts on that. The log is excluded
 * from the litestream backup, so this is local disk only and never S3.
