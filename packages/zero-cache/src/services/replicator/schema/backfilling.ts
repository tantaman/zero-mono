/**
 * The replica's backfill cookie, keyed by upstream identity.
 *
 * `_zero.column_metadata.backfill` already records which columns are being
 * backfilled, and it stays authoritative for `isBackfilling`, which is what the
 * replica's own read paths use. What it cannot do is name the table an upstream
 * would recognize: it is keyed by *lite* table name, and `liteTableName()`
 * collapses the `public` schema and has no inverse anywhere in the tree. A lite
 * name containing a dot is ambiguous — `{public, "a.b"}` and `{a, b}` produce
 * the same string — and a table with backfilling columns and no
 * `_zero.tableMetadata` row (legal, since its metadata is optional) cannot be
 * resolved at all.
 *
 * That is the whole of what blocks a change log from being initialized out of a
 * restored replica, so this table carries the identity the reconstruction needs:
 * a straight row copy into the change log's own cookie tables, with nothing to
 * reconstruct and nothing to guess. The replica's copy is the *seed* source; the
 * change log's copy (`replicator/change-log-cookies.ts`) is the *working* set,
 * folded forward from the seed as the log's head advances.
 *
 * The cost is a second copy of `backfill` inside the replica, taken
 * deliberately — though not to save writes: `_zero.column_metadata` is written
 * only by initial sync, the DDL handlers, and backfill completion, so two more
 * columns on it would be free. It is a matter of shape. That table is keyed by
 * lite table name, so `schema`/`table` would be non-key duplicates of its own
 * key, to be held in sync with it across every rename with no answer to which
 * encoding is authoritative. This one is keyed exactly as `cdc.backfilling` and
 * `_zero.changeLogBackfilling` are, which is what makes the change log's
 * initialization comparison a row-set diff rather than a translation, and what
 * lets all three stores interpret the same fold. It also holds in-flight backfills and nothing else,
 * where the same query against `column_metadata` is an unindexed scan over a row
 * per column of every table.
 *
 * This table is write-only from the replica's perspective. Nothing in the
 * replicator reads it; it exists to be read by the change-streamer.
