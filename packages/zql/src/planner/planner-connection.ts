/**
 * Represents a connection to a source (table scan).
 *
 * # Dual State Pattern
 * Like all planner nodes, PlannerConnection separates:
 * 1. immutable structure: Ordering, filters, cost model (set at construction)
 * 2. mutable state: Pinned status, constraints (mutated during planning)
 *
 * # Cost Estimation
 * The ordering and filters determine the initial cost. As planning progresses,
 * constraints from parent joins refine the cost estimate.
 *
 * # Constraint Flow
 * When a connection is pinned as the outer loop, it reveals constraints for
 * connected joins. These constraints propagate through the graph, allowing
 * other connections to update their cost estimates.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * builder.issue.whereExists('assignee', a => a.where('name', 'Alice'))
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * [issue]  [assignee]
 *   |         |
 *   |         +-- where name = 'Alice'
 *    \        /
 *     \      /
 *      [join]
 *        |
 * ```
 *
 * - Initial state: Both connections have no constraints, costs are unconstrained
 * - If `issue` chosen first: Reveals constraint `assignee_id` for assignee connection
 * - If `assignee` chosen first: Reveals constraint `assignee_id` for issue connection
 * - Updated costs guide the next selection
 *
 * # Pushed conditions
 * Correlated predicate pushdown copies a parent's condition on a correlation
 * column into the child (`pushed`). When the parent drives the join into the
 * child, the join binds that column to a parent row, so the parent's
 * condition implies the copy and the copy removes no rows. The connection
 * leaves such a copy out of the cost model call. Another join that binds the
 * column does not imply the copy, because its rows need not hold the parent's
 * condition. The connection also leaves every copy out of `selectivity`: a
 * semi-join always binds the column, and a flipped join gets the copy's
 * reduction through `returnedRows` instead.
 *
 * # Lifecycle
 * 1. Construct with immutable structure (ordering, filters, cost model)
 * 2. Wire to output node during graph construction
 * 3. Planning mutates pinned status and accumulates constraints
 * 4. reset() clears mutable state for replanning
