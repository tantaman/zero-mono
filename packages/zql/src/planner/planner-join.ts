 * - Need to execute a separate correlation check for each parent row
 * - Cannot leverage combined constraint checking as effectively as flipped joins
 *

 * than equivalent flipped joins, which empirically matches observed performance

/**
 * Represents a join between two data streams (parent and child).
 *
 * # Dual-State Pattern
 * Like all planner nodes, PlannerJoin separates:
 * 1. IMMUTABLE STRUCTURE: Parent/child nodes, constraints, flippability, operator
 * 2. MUTABLE STATE: Join type (semi/flipped), pinned status
 *
 * # Join Flipping
 * A join can be in two states:
 * - 'semi': Parent is outer loop, child is inner (semi-join for EXISTS)
 * - 'flipped': Child is outer loop, parent is inner
 *
 * Flipping is the key optimization: choosing which table scans first.
 * NOT EXISTS joins cannot be flipped (#flippable = false): a flipped join
 * discovers parent rows by scanning children, but the parents NOT EXISTS
 * returns are precisely those with no child rows to scan.
 *
 * # NOT EXISTS (anti-join) costing
 * NOT EXISTS executes as the same existence probe as EXISTS (fetch child
 * rows for the parent's correlation, check whether any exist), so its cost
 * structure matches a semi-join. Its selectivity is inverted, however: a
 * parent row passes when NO child matches, so the pass rate is the
 * complement of the EXISTS match rate (clamped — see
 * MIN_ANTI_JOIN_SELECTIVITY).
 *
 * # Constraint Propagation
 * - Semi-join: Sends childConstraint to child, forwards received constraints to parent
 * - Flipped join: Sends undefined to child, merges parentConstraint with received to parent
 * - Unpinned join: Only forwards constraints to parent (doesn't constrain child yet)
 *
 * # Lifecycle
 * 1. Construct with immutable structure (parent, child, constraints, flippability)
 * 2. Wire to output node during graph construction
 * 3. Planning calls flipIfNeeded() based on connection selection order
 * 4. pin() locks the join type once chosen
 * 5. reset() clears mutable state (type → 'semi', pinned → false)
